This script will take files that are output from the CIF (collective-intelligence-framework) http://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/ using its csv plugin.

Those files will then be parsed and selected fields are then parsed and a ArcSight CEF message is created and sent via Syslog to an Arcsight Syslog connector.
